## Summary:
---

The idea behind our game is to create a classic platformer with a twist, instead of using simple navigational keys to move, the player will have to type out words in order to keep the character moving and score points! The game is set to be in a modern context. There may be other objects in the game further complicating the game and improving it.

## Technologies:
---

+ Technologies, tools, Web APIs, Web Servers that you plan to use and how they all fit together to satisfy the project requirements 
 
+ WebGL / Canvas Web API 

    +  Phaser would make use of the WebGL or Canvas Web API to render our game on the browser. We will be using the many web packages of Phaser to make our game more presentable. These could include various physics settings, player movement and many more. We will use different images in our game to make it look different and abstract. These images will be imported from outside sources or rendered differently. 
 
+ Git 

    + We will be using the Git software for version management and development. Also we will use its push and pull features to code more efficiently and quickly. 
 
+ Github Pages 

    + We will be using Github Pages to host our application to allow public access. 

 
+ VHS code is the ide that we will be using to program. It has many features that makes programming simpler and easier. 

    + Along with VHS code we will also be using Visual Studio as a code editor. 

 

+ Fetch API 

    + We will be utilizing the fetch API to create a small leaderboard of scores. This may be either local scores or all scores on the game (or both). This will allow users to keep track of their progress and monitor how they perform versus other players. 

+ The game will use all these to complement the game and host the game so that people who have the link will be able to play it and if needed modify it. The github pages allow people to view the code while git itself will allow people to modify if it has been made public. Also git has the HTTPs connection to allow many people to clone the same project.
